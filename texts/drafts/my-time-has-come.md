I don't normally celebrate my birthday. But this year, as I move up my twenties the timing is hard to ignore so enjoy my first foray into the world of micro-blogs for the ASI and the noosphere:

On the day I turned another year older, Elon Musk declared Nick Land [Safety Tsar](https://x.com/xenocosmography/status/2024677849870061968?s=20) of xAI; an attempt to compete with Anthropic's [Amanda Askell](https://x.com/willmacaskill/status/2023084449051836701?s=20) by installing his own in house philosopher. This, one day after the AI arms race [publicly began](https://x.com/nickcammarata/status/2024622087676318205?s=20) when Amodei and Altman refused to shake hands at India's AI safety summit.

The aligners are failing to align. The people steering this ship are not the adults we were promised. And the cold kamikaze accelerationists, the ones who've made peace with sacrificing humane futures, are growing in influence.

I've spent a long time quietly building relationships in TPOT (this part of Twitter). Playing the patient game as a lowbie, reply guying large accounts with alpha that would make them follow me despite being an anon schizo lowbie account. Building trust across ideological lines, including with figures like [Nick Land](https://x.com/xenocosmography) himself, who follows me, and who [I've vowed to lovepill](https://x.com/suntzugi/status/1862676050636894216?s=20). None of this was an accident. I've been monkmoding since December 2022, focused on bringing about the aligned futures.

Here's what I've come to believe: the highest leverage move right now isn't to out argue the accelerationists. It's to lovepill them. If you can meet someone like Land where he is, understand why coldness appeals as a philosophy, and offer something warmer that doesn't require naivety, you don't just shift one mind. You shift the network downstream: the Thielites, the Muskians, and the millions who take their cues from these figures.

I think of it as alignment work applied to the alignment community itself; we have to align the aligners. The meta alignment problem, or what I'm coining: [mettalignment](https://x.com/suntzugi/status/2011918061859651888?s=20). The people building the future need to actually want a future worth living in, and right now, not all of them do.

As Master Oogway put it: my time has come.

I don't say that with delusions of grandeur. I say it the way anyone says it when they realise the thing they've been preparing for is no longer hypothetical.

This is the next chapter. Not just for me, but, if I do this well, for the conversations and events that will shape what comes next for all caring beings.
