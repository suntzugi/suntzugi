# My Time Has Come

There is a moment — not loud, not dramatic — when the turtle lifts its head and knows. Not because the world changed, but because something inside finally stopped resisting what it always was.

Master Oogway stood at the edge of the peach tree, petals falling around him like the universe exhaling. He did not fight it. He did not mourn it. He smiled — because the whole point was never to stay.

The whole point was to show someone else how to bloom.

My time has come. Not as an ending, but as a turning. The version of me that needed to prove, to chase, to explain — that version completed its arc. What remains is simpler: the quiet work of mending, the patience of gold poured into cracks, the faith that light reaches what it needs to reach.

This is not a farewell. It is a beginning that looks like stillness.
